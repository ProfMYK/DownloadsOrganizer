# Downloads Organizer

Organizes your downloads folder by moving the files to another folder that is associated with it. For example if there is a file called *image.png* it moves it to a folder called *Images*.

You can add custom folders for some specific file extensions. For example you have a lot of files that have the extensions *py*, *pyw* or *pyc*. You can add a custom folder called *Python* and add the extensions *py*, *pyw* and *pyc*. And the script automatically moves all the files that has the extension *py*, *pyw* or *pyc* to the *Python* folder.
